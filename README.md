This is a Repl template setup for [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) projects utilizing Typescript.  The template was created using [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app) with Typescript options.

Note: This project is using newer versions of key packages than the current NextJS template on Replit.

Next: 12.1.0 => 12.1.6
React: 17.0.2 => 18.1.0
React-Dom: 17.02 => 18.1.0

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
